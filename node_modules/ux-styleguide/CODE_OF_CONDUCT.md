## Contributor Code of Conduct

This is a place to ask questions, work through any challenges, and share ideas and best practices. The following suggestions and guidelines are intended to make the community easier and more enjoyable to use.

### TL;DR

* **Respect for all people** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively and with respect.

### General 
As contributors and maintainers of the Enterprise Design System, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of UX Ops channels (GitHub, Email, Slack) must be constructive and never resort to unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in contribution regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the Enterprise Design System and associated resources to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the UX Ops team may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email us at uxops@homedepot.com.

### Slack #eux_designsystem
1. Please, no `@here` or `@channel` unless it is a bug that is **breaking production code.** We have slack members in many different time zones, and we would hate to disrupt someone.
2. There's no need to notify the UX Ops team that you have made an issue in the UX GitHub repositories. We check these several times a day, so we promise we'll address your issue as soon as we can. 
3. Reserve direct messages for sensitive discussions, such as privacy, legal, or HR reasons. Otherwise, we encourage posting in public channels so people with the same questions can benefit.
4. If you have a pressing bug fix, it is best to make a PR directly to get your issues addressed. 
6. `#eux_designsystem`: Please post any design questions with an in-context screen shot (i.e. screen shot of the whole UI you are designing) with background as to what you are trying to accomplish in this flow. We welcome in-progress work to get community design feedback as well.
